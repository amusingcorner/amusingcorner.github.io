      <title>Ignorance</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This ignorance doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me. I know you&amp;rsquo;ve got family friends and I am assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably got someone else in your life too by now.. its been 6 months.
But here I am dying from inside bit by bit. Every trip I go to, every book I read, every day I come back from office, every morning I wake up, I feel how important you were in my life. Right now I have just one wish from the universe to get you back, to marry you and spend my entire life with you. In return It can give me all the troubles. I will fight with each of them without ever complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>तैरना सीख ले</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- &#34;Poem about realizing the truth that someone has gone, either you prep to reach there or keep waiting for them&#34; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
तुम जा रहे हो दूर मुझसे हर पल,&lt;br&gt;
पर ये दिल है की खुद को ही छलने में लगा है।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;नादां है की नहीं जानता इतनी सी बात,&lt;br&gt;
वो जा चुका है समंदर के उस पार ।&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;या तो तैरना सीख ले, या युहीं बैठा रह किनारे पर,&lt;br&gt;
इस आस में कि वो लौट के आएगा इस पार।&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>choices, decisions and goals</title>
      <link>http://kuchankahi.github.io/blog/choices-decision-goals/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2016 11:24:53 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kuchankahi.github.io/blog/choices-decision-goals/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Choices you make for long term or short term, for next hour or next day, next week, or next year creates your personality. It is similar to how flowing river creates those rounds stones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one right or wrong decision doesn&amp;rsquo;t ensure whether you are going to be successful person or a failure. Its about making those similar right choices again and again will take you where you want to be&amp;hellip; you have to imagine your future and then keep making choices which will keep ensuring that you reach more closer to that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not just one goal but combination of many. You just don&amp;rsquo;t want to reach exactly at one goal point. There are two ways to be successful in this case.
First is to reach till a point where all of them are at almost same distance from where you are. In this case sometimes you have to make some choices which will take you closer to one but little farther from another. Next time you choose the opposite. This path will frustrate you at multiple points in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way is choose the goals which are already close to each other. You focus on one of them and make choice to go closer to one of them but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t pull you away from others at that moment. This way you are becoming successful as well as happy simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is third way as well but thats not for common people like us.. that is to choose an ultimate goal in life and chase it till your last breath. You have to sacrifices hell lot of things on the way but after achieving that one ultimate thing, everything else will seem so tiny. For example Gautam Buddha, he chose to find the ultimate truth and in the process he sacrificed all the materialistic goals a human can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the beginning you chose the goals or a goal then you make choices and in the end you become successful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>courage and confidence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To achieve anything big in life courage and confidence are two primary requirements. Everything else is secondary, which you can delegate someone else. Money you can lend, for skills and hard work you can hire someone, but courage &amp;amp; confidence have to be your own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By failing again and again, I have tried all those paths which does not take me to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am only left with one path and I now where exactly it leads to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working at startup</title>
      <link>http://kuchankahi.github.io/blog/working-at-startup/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 11:59:54 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kuchankahi.github.io/blog/working-at-startup/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working at a startup can be compared to a situation where you are a hungry person and you have a locked box with you. This box is filled with food. The lock on box automatically opens after 3rd day. Not exactly on 3rd day but random day after 3rd day.. And this number 3 which can be any other number is based upon observing so many other hungry people&amp;rsquo;s boxes.
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about dying by hunger, you&amp;rsquo;ll be given one peanut every hour until the box opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So conclusion is that if you can control your hunger for the time being, or if you have some other parallel source of food, or preserved food, then only signup for this kind of madness, otherwise stay away.&lt;/p&gt;
