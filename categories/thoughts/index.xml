      <description>&lt;p&gt;This ignorance doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me. I know you&amp;rsquo;ve got family friends and I am assuming that you&amp;rsquo;ve probably got someone else in your life too by now.. its been 6 months.
But here I am dying from inside bit by bit. Every trip I go to, every book I read, every day I come back from office, every morning I wake up, I feel how important you were in my life. Right now I have just one wish from the universe to get you back, to marry you and spend my entire life with you. In return It can give me all the troubles. I will fight with each of them without ever complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
