Working at a startup can be compared to a situation where you are a hungry person and you have a locked box with you. This box is filled with food. The lock on box automatically opens after 3rd day. Not exactly on 3rd day but random day after 3rd day.. And this number 3 which can be any other number is based upon observing so many other hungry people's boxes.
Don't worry about dying by hunger, you'll be given one peanut every hour until the box opens.

So conclusion is that if you can control your hunger for the time being, or if you have some other parallel source of food, or preserved food, then only signup for this kind of madness, otherwise stay away.
