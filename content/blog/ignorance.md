This ignorance doesn't bother me. I know you've got family friends and I am assuming that you've probably got someone else in your life too by now.. its been 6 months.
But here I am dying from inside bit by bit. Every trip I go to, every book I read, every day I come back from office, every morning I wake up, I feel how important you were in my life. Right now I have just one wish from the universe to get you back, to marry you and spend my entire life with you. In return It can give me all the troubles. I will fight with each of them without ever complaining.
