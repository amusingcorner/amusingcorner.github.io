Times are tough, which is always the case, but this time it's different. It's like you want something/someone so bad in this world but you know that you can't have it in this lifetime, atleast.

Even I had someone with whom I could spent my entire life and nothing else would give me more happiness than just being with that person. Instead time takes a sharp turn and everything you hold with you gets tossed up out of the windows. Time never stops, and you can never go back so you can just wait for that turn to meet them again on the way somewhere. It's just a long wait....
