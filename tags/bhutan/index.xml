      <description>Choices you make for long term or short term, for next hour or next day, next week, or next year creates your personality. It is similar to how flowing river creates those rounds stones.
Just one right or wrong decision doesn&amp;rsquo;t ensure whether you are going to be successful person or a failure. Its about making those similar right choices again and again will take you where you want to be&amp;hellip; you have to imagine your future and then keep making choices which will keep ensuring that you reach more closer to that goal.</description>
